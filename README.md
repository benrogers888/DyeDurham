Technical Tests for Dye Durham

I have used Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 as my desktop is 8 years old. I had a work laptop before I was made redundant and on that I had Visual Studio 2022

I have used Test Driven Development to do this exercise. That is I wrote the unit tests before the actual code.

The executable is named name-sorter.exe and it supports the argument of ?

The unit tests are available in Test Explorer

There are three projects in the solution. They include a Console App project, Unit Test project and a class library.
